I'm a Web Developer based in Newcastle upon Tyne, currently employed as a front-end engineer at [Server Density](https://www.serverdensity.com/). I've given talks at a variety of events, such as FrontendNE, JS North East and Super Mondays. I've also given a workshop at jQuery UK â€” which, at the time, was the biggest front-end conference in the UK. I've also been published in Netmag magazine.

Outside of code I absolutely adore animals. I own a German Shepherd called Rupert and several pet rats. I'm also an avid gamer (PC being my platform of choice).
