I’m a Web Developer based in Newcastle upon Tyne, currently employed as a Frontend Engineer at [Server Density](https://www.serverdensity.com/). I’ve given talks at a variety of events, such as FrontendNE, JS North East and Super Mondays; given a workshop at jQuery UK — which, at the time, was the biggest front-end conference in the UK; and been published in Netmag magazine.

Outside of work I can usually be found with my Fiancé and Rupert our German Shepherd, gaming, riding on mountain bike trails or wandering in the woods.
