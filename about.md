I’m a Web Developer based in Newcastle upon Tyne, currently employed as a Frontend Engineer at [Server Density](https://www.serverdensity.com/). I’ve given talks at a variety of events – such as FrontendNE, JS North East and Super Mondays. I've given a workshop at jQuery UK — which, at the time, was the biggest Frontend conference in the UK. I've also been published in Net magazine.

Outside of work I can usually be found scaling walls at the climbing gym, spending time with my Fiancé and Rupert (our GSD), kicking up mud on MTB trails, gaming or getting overexcited about food.
