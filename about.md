I’m a Software Engineer based in Newcastle upon Tyne. I'm currently working at [Elastic](https://www.elastic.co/) on the Infrastructure and Logs UI solutions within Kibana. I’ve given talks at a variety of events – such as FrontendNE, JS North East and Super Mondays. I've given a workshop at jQuery UK — which, at the time, was the biggest Frontend conference in the UK. I've also been published in Net magazine.

Outside of work my interests generally revolve around keeping active — climbing, yoga, lifting weights, hiking and the odd bit of mountain biking.
