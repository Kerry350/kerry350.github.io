As of this month I end my 2.5 years of employment with Audacious, and move to Blooie to become one of their developers.

It's not just me though, I'll be moving there with @coding_bear. I'm really excited that we'll be able to continue working together, and alongside some awesome new developers.  

It's been a rocky couple of months, and I'll miss working with certain people. In particular I'd like to wish all the best to @xocs who has moved to create amazing things for the hotel industry. 

I'm really excited about getting started at Blooie. Lots of Node.js and Ember.js to keep someone that loves JS happy. Many thanks to Mark and Chris for allowing the two of us to join their team :)
