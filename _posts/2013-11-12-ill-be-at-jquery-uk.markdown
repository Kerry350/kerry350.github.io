Tickets for [jQuery UK](http://jqueryuk.com/) went on sale yesterday. I'll be part of the third track, giving a hands-on 85 minute session on WYSIWYG editors. This is my first time doing something like this, but I aim to make it as interesting and helpful as I possibly can. The speaker lineup looks awesome, so get yourself along :)
