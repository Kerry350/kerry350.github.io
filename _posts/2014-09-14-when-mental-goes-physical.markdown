I've had a rough couple of weeks. A few weeks ago Cam had a bug - nothing serious, but a nuisance all the same - which brought nausea, vomiting and so on. I too started to feel very nauseous every day, I figured I'd caught Cam's bug. Thing is this persisted, and it came with a whole myriad of other symptoms. 


* Nausea (but no vomiting, so without the relief)
* Worse headaches than normal
* Tingling sensation in my fingers
* Extreme lack of concentration and ability to perform tasks
* A cloudy / foggy head
* Dizziness
* Dry mouth and an inability to quench my thirst
* Heart palpitations
* Sweating. So much sweating

This was really starting to annoy me (understandably). I finally worked out what was going on. My anxiety / depression had turned in to something that presented physical symptoms. I don't know whether I'd call myself 'lucky' but up until about a fortnight ago my anxiety / depression was mainly a mental manifestation, no physical symptoms. I could literally think of something anxiety inducing and all of the things listed above would hit me like a ton of bricks. 

My job is very learning / thinking oriented, and I'm finding it exceptionally difficult to do simple things. It's awfully hard to explain, but I just can't absorb anything. I can sit and read things...over and over...but none of it sinks in. 

The nausea is awful. It's right there in the pit of my stomach when I wake up and persists throughout the day. If a 'trigger' hits it turns in to a wave through my body. That exact feeing you get when mass panic hits. Say you, for a fleeting moment, think you've lost something really expensive, or you've turned up to a gig 100 miles away without the tickets...that 'wave' like feeling. The worst thing is that wave comes and goes throughout the day at random intervals too.

This physical manifestation is new to me. I'll be honest it's both scary and also exceptionally annoying. It's getting in the way of me performing my job properly. It's getting in the way of performing tasks at home properly. People are starting to notice my 'slowness'.  

I really don't want to go back on medication, but I'm fairly certain that'll be the case. I need my concentration back at the very least, even if that means feeling on the brink of throwing up all day, every day.
